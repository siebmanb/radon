Radon
=====

Radon is a chemical element, a radioactive, colorless, odorless and tasteless noble gas. It is simple, yet powerful, just like this app that helps you manage your reading notes.

Radon is a mobile app built using jQuery and Cordova. The project is offered with the complete Cordova architecture, allowing you to deploy and test the app right away.

## Instructions
To deploy the app, execute the following command in a console, located in the project folder
   cordova build ios
or
   cordova build android
	
Then you will find your native project (XCode or Java) inside the platforms folder.
